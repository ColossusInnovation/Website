After 15+ years building systems at scale and a decade of consulting on the side, I'm excited to officially launch **Colossus Innovation LLC**.

### What We Do

I help companies solve their hardest technical problems:
- Systems breaking under scale
- Fractional CTO guidance
- AI/LLM implementations that actually work in production
- Technical expertise for patent litigation

### Why Work With Me?

I've been in the trenches. From architecting Braze's global messaging infrastructure to reviewing code for patent disputes to implementing AI features across multiple startups, I bring battle-tested expertise to your specific challenges.

<br>

No cookie-cutter solutions. No unnecessary complexity. Just proven approaches to turn your technical challenges into competitive advantages.
